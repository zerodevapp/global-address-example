# Global Address

Global Address is a cross-chain token bridging solution that allows users to send tokens to a single address and automatically bridge them to destination chain. 

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install  # or `npm install`

# Run vanilla example (user pays fees)
npx ts-node src/index.ts

# Run sponsored example (developer pays fees)
npx ts-node src/sponsor.ts
```

## Examples

This project contains:

- **`src/index.ts`** - Vanilla global address where users pay bridging fees
- **`src/sponsor.ts`** - Developer-sponsored fees (requires `ZERODEV_PROJECT_ID` in `.env`)

## Environment Setup (For Sponsored Fees)

Create a `.env` file:
```env
ZERODEV_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here
```

## How to Test

1. Run either example to get your global address
2. Send tokens to the global address from supported chains (Arbitrum, Mainnet, Optimism)
3. Check the destination chain (Base) to see tokens received
